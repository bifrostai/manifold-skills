## Summary

Take a wrap from the `wrap-policy` skill (a Python module that exports
`PROFILE`, `BENCHMARK`, and `PIPELINE`) and get it running on the Manifold
platform.

The output is four things:

1. **A `Dockerfile`** that this skill writes next to the wrap. It builds
   the policy image.
2. **A launcher script** (`serve.py`) that this skill writes next to the
   wrap. It imports the pairing module and calls `launch_server`. Phase 3
   shows the exact code to paste in.
3. **A container image** pushed to the registry at the agreed name and
   tag (e.g. `ghcr.io/<org>/policy-<slug>:0.1.0`).
4. **A registered policy version** on the Manifold platform. This is a
   catalog entry created by `manifold policy init` that points at the
   image.

Files 1 and 2 are new files on disk. The other two live on the registry
and on the platform.

Once all four exist, the skill's job is done. After that, ask the user
whether to submit a scored test run against a benchmark of their choice
(Phase 4 walks through it). Do not submit a run on your own.

This skill does not fix wrap bugs. If the wrap does not pass both
`check_compatibility` and `verify`, go back to `wrap-policy` first.

## Rules

**Do not run this skill without an explicit user invocation.** If another
skill (for example `/wrap-policy`) has just finished, stop and wait for
the user to ask for containerization by name. Do **not** chain into this
skill on your own after "the wrap is proven" or any similar success line.
Each step in the Manifold flow is a separate skill so the user can
review the previous step's output before spending registry storage and
cloud time; auto-chaining skips that review.

**Plan the entire task in a to-do list before you start, and update it as
you go.** Use whichever planning tool your harness provides:

- **Claude Code:** `TaskCreate` to seed the plan, `TaskUpdate` to move items
  between `pending` / `in_progress` / `completed`, `TaskList` / `TaskGet` to
  read state.
- **Codex:** use `update_plan` to create and maintain an ordered plan, with
  exactly one item `in_progress` at a time. Keep the scored test run as an
  explicit item until it passes.
- **Other harnesses:** check the harness for a to-do list or planning tool
  before using the fallback below.
- **No planning tool available:** keep the plan as a plain-text checklist in
  your responses and re-post it (with statuses updated) each time you advance.

The intent is (1) to **structure the work** so nothing gets skipped, and
(2) to **stay accountable and informative** by updating the list as steps
start and finish, so the user can follow along without asking.

**Ask the user before every step that costs money or writes to a shared
system.** Each of the choices below costs the user time, cloud credits, or
registry storage. Do not pick any of them yourself:

- The target benchmark for the scored test run — never pick "a reasonable
  benchmark" for the user.
- Pushing the image to the registry.
- Registering the policy on the platform.
- Submitting a run.

At each of those points: state what you are about to do, wait for a
confirmation, and only then proceed. Do not chain "wrap built successfully,
now submitting a run against <a benchmark>" into one action. **If the user
declines any of these, stop the skill there — do not skip to the next
step.**

The **policy name** — the thing that becomes `<slug>` in
`manifold policy init <slug>` — is **not** on that list. A separate setup
skill picks it and hands it here. Do not rename the policy on the user's
behalf. If the slug is missing, ask the user once for it.

The container image name (registry, namespace, tag) is a
container-registry concept, not a user-facing choice. This skill
constructs it from the policy slug plus the org's registry and
namespace.

## How the platform runs a policy

The platform runs policies as registered container images. When a run is
dispatched, the runner pulls the image, starts it, waits for the server
inside to accept connections on port 8000, and then drives it through the
benchmark.

Three consequences follow:

1. **One image per wrap.** The `CMD` in the Dockerfile picks which wrap the
   container serves. Registration cannot override it.
2. **Tags become versions.** `manifold policy init` reads the image tag and
   uses it as the version string. Never reuse a tag — old tags are
   immutable.
3. **Nothing local proves the image works end to end.** A clean local
   `docker run` only shows that the server starts. Whether the platform
   can pull, schedule, drive, and score the image is only settled by an
   actual scored run — which is up to the user to submit.

---

## Phase 1: Understand the inputs

Do this before writing a Dockerfile. You need the wrap module path, the
policy name, and the manifold-sdk version pinned down first.

**The wrap.** Confirm the wrap passes both `check_compatibility` and
`verify` under `wrap-policy`. Record the module path that exports
`PROFILE`, `BENCHMARK`, and `PIPELINE` — the Dockerfile's `CMD` will name
it.

**The policy name.** This is the slug used in `manifold policy init
<slug>`. The setup skill picks it (or the user does directly). If it is
missing, ask the user once for it. Do not invent one.

**The image name.** Built from the policy slug plus the org's registry
and namespace, in the shape:
`<registry>/<namespace>/policy-<slug>:<tag>` — for example
`ghcr.io/<your-org>/policy-mypolicy-mybench:0.1.0`. The tag is a version
string; bump it for every change to the wrap or the Dockerfile. This
skill constructs the image name from those parts — do not ask the user
to type it out.

Examples below use `ghcr.io/<your-org>` — substitute the actual registry
and namespace throughout.

**The manifold-sdk version.** Install the same manifold-sdk version the
wrap was written against — read it from the wrap's environment
(`uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, or `uv pip freeze`). The policy and the
benchmark exchange messages defined by the SDK, and mismatched versions
can silently disagree at run time.

> **Phase 1 checkpoint.** Record before designing:
> ```
> wrap_module      = ?  (e.g. mywrap.mypolicy_mybench)
> checks_pass      = yes (link to wrap-policy handoff)
> policy_slug      = ?  (source: setup skill | user)
> image_name       = <registry>/<namespace>/policy-<slug>:<tag>
>                    (constructed by this skill from the slug)
> sdk_version      = ?  (from wrap-policy environment)
> ```

---

## Phase 2: Design the Dockerfile

Decide what the image will contain before writing any of it. Everything in
this phase is a decision, not implementation.

### What goes in the image

Assume the user has a project folder with the model's code and
dependencies. Whether it's a cloned git repo, a fork, a local working
directory, or a messy research folder on a shared workstation — treat
it the same way.

The image contains, in this order:

1. **A base image** with Python and CUDA matching what the model was
   trained on. Pin it by digest, not by a floating tag like `latest`,
   so rebuilds are reproducible. If unsure, an official CUDA runtime
   image on Ubuntu for the trained CUDA version is a safe default.
2. **The model project's dependencies**, installed with `uv`. In most
   cases: `uv sync` if the project has a `pyproject.toml` and
   `uv.lock`, or `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` if it only ships
   a requirements file. Fall back to whatever the project actually
   supports (conda env, raw `pip`) only if `uv` cannot handle it.
3. **manifold-sdk**, installed on top with `uv pip install manifold-sdk`
   at the version the wrap was written against.
4. **The parts of the project folder that the wrap imports from.**
   `driver.py` names what inference needs — trace its imports (and
   their transitive imports) back to the folders they live in, and
   `COPY` only those. Skip everything else: training scripts, datasets,
   logs (`wandb/`, `tb_logs/`), notebooks, alternate checkpoints,
   `.git`. Use a `.dockerignore` or an explicit list of `COPY` paths.
   If the container crashes at startup on a missing import, add that
   path. Set `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app` (or wherever you copied to) so the
   imports resolve.
5. **The wrap module and the launcher** — `profile.py`, `driver.py`,
   the pairing file, and `serve.py` — copied into the `WORKDIR`.

### Pin the project source

For rebuilds to match, the project folder's state has to be pinned.
If the folder is in git, pin the commit with a build `ARG` and check
it out during build. If it isn't, snapshot the folder (a tarball
saved somewhere durable) and record which snapshot the image was
built from. Bumping that pin is a separate decision from bumping the
manifold-sdk version.

### Weights: fetched or baked?

Two ways to get the model checkpoint into the running container:

- **Fetched at first load.** The profile's `default_weights` contains a
  hub id or path. Point the model library's checkpoint cache at
  `/opt/manifold/cache` (whatever env var it uses — `HF_HOME` for
  Hugging Face, `TORCH_HOME` for torch hub, etc.). The platform mounts
  a persistent host directory at that path, so the download happens
  once per box and is reused across runs.

  The container has a 10-minute window to become ready (bind port 8000
  and accept a TCP connection). That window covers both the download
  and the load into GPU memory. A large checkpoint may not finish in
  time on a cold box — for those, prefer baking.

  **If the checkpoint needs a credential** (gated Hugging Face repo,
  private hub repo, private S3 bucket), you cannot use "fetched at
  first load" today — the platform does not currently give you a way
  to hand a run-time credential to your container. Bake the checkpoint
  in instead. Do **not** try to work around this by putting the
  credential in the image (`ENV HF_TOKEN=...`, copied
  `~/.huggingface/token`, etc.); anyone who pulls the image gets it.
- **Baked into the image.** Copy the checkpoint files in at build
  time. Two common cases:
  - **You already have the weights on disk** (a checkpoint from your
    training run, a folder you downloaded earlier). Just `COPY` the
    files into the image — no auth, no download, done.
  - **You need to fetch them from a private source at build time.** Do
    it on a machine where you already have the credential, so `pip`,
    `huggingface-cli`, or `aws` can resolve the download using your
    local auth. The credential never enters the image, only the
    resolved files do.

  Only copy what inference needs; hub snapshots often include
  optimizer states, training configs, and alternate checkpoints that
  add size without being used. Baking trades a larger image and
  slower pushes for not having to fetch at run time.

### How the wrap gets served

The container's `CMD` runs a small launcher script that imports the wrap
module and hands its `PROFILE` / `BENCHMARK` / `PIPELINE` to
`launch_server`. Phase 3 shows the launcher and the `CMD` line. Nothing
else in the image needs to know about the wrap.

> **Phase 2 checkpoint:**
> ```
> base_image         = ?  (pinned by digest)
> project_pin        = ?  (git commit ARG | tarball snapshot path)
> weights_approach   = fetched at first load | baked
> ```

---

## Phase 3: Build and push the image

Write the Dockerfile and build it. On a GPU box, run it locally to prove
the server starts; on a CPU-only box, skip the local run. Then push it
to the registry.

### Dockerfile rules

These apply to every image:

**Port 8000.** The container must listen on port 8000.
`DEFAULT_CONTAINER_PORT` is set to 8000 in the runner code and registration
cannot change it. Bind `0.0.0.0:8000` in the `CMD`.

**Bash is required.** The readiness probe runs
`bash -c 'exec 3<>/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/8000'` inside the container. Install
bash if the base image doesn't have it.

**`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`.** Set this in the Dockerfile. Without it, a
crashing container's last output lines stay in a write buffer and are lost.
That output is how you diagnose failures.

**Layer order.** Put the model's large dependencies (torch, jax, CUDA
wheels) in early layers. Put manifold-sdk and your wrap code in later
layers. That way, editing the wrap rebuilds only the cheap layers at
the end.

**Pin the model's dependencies.** manifold-sdk declares dependency
floors with no ceilings. A fresh resolution inside a rebuild can
upgrade a package the model cannot use. Pin the model's `numpy`,
`scipy`, and similar packages in the image to prevent that.

**No network fetches at model construction.** If the loader downloads
anything at construction time (pretrained weights, tokenizer files),
disable it or copy the files into the image at build time. A container in
an offline environment will fail at load otherwise.

**GPU memory pre-allocation.** Some frameworks claim all GPU memory at
startup — JAX does this by default. Disable that behavior in the
Dockerfile with the framework's environment variable. Otherwise, on a
shared box, all GPU memory is consumed before the benchmark renderer
starts.

### Launcher and CMD

Write a small launcher script that imports the wrap module by name and
starts the server:

```python
"""Serve a wrapped policy over TCP."""
import argparse, importlib
from manifold.recipes import launch_server, read_pairing

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--port", type=int, required=True)
    parser.add_argument("--host", default="0.0.0.0")
    parser.add_argument("--pairing", required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    pairing = read_pairing(importlib.import_module(args.pairing))
    launch_server([pairing], port=args.port, host=args.host)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

`COPY` the wrap module (the file exporting `PROFILE`, `BENCHMARK`,
`PIPELINE`, plus `profile.py` and `driver.py`) and the launcher into the
`WORKDIR`, then:

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "serve.py", "--pairing", "my_wrap.mypolicy_mybench", \
     "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Build

```sh
docker build -f <path-to-Dockerfile> \
    -t <registry>/<namespace>/policy-<slug>:<tag> .
```

A clean `docker build` means the image assembled without errors, nothing
more. The server has not run yet.

### Run it locally (only if the local box has a GPU)

Skip this step on a CPU-only machine. A robotics policy needs a GPU to
load and serve, so a CPU-only local run only tells you whether Python
could import — not whether the container actually works. On CPU-only,
proceed straight to Push; the container will first be exercised for
real when the user submits a run in Phase 4.

On a GPU box, start the container and confirm the server prints its
listening line:

```sh
docker run --gpus all <image>:<tag>
```

Look for:
```
listening on 0.0.0.0:8000 (TCP), up to 8 concurrent shard(s)
```

Dependency conflicts, import errors, and model loading failures surface
here, not during build. If the listening line does not appear (crash,
hang, silent exit), **do not push** — fix the Dockerfile or the wrap
and rebuild first.

### Push

**Save the Dockerfile and launcher before you push.** If they get lost
or overwritten later, no one can rebuild the image or see what code
went into it.

**Ask the user before pushing.** Show them the exact image name and tag,
and wait for confirmation.

```sh
docker login ghcr.io   # or the registry the user chose
docker push <registry>/<namespace>/policy-<slug>:<tag>
```

**Make sure the platform can pull the image.** Two paths:

- **Public registry** (a public ghcr package, a public Docker Hub repo).
  Pull just works, no credentials involved. A new ghcr package starts
  private — flip it to public at
  `https://github.com/orgs/<org>/packages/container/<package>/settings`
  before any run.
- **Private registry** (private ghcr package, private Docker Hub repo,
  ECR, Artifact Registry). The platform needs a pull credential
  configured on its side. Confirm with the Bifrost team before
  submitting a run.

Either way, a pull failure at run time surfaces as a scheduling or pull
error, not "permission denied" — so if the platform can't reach the
image, the run just looks broken.

> **Phase 3 checkpoint:**
> ```
> build_exit_code        = 0
> listening_line         = yes | no | skipped (CPU-only local box)
> source_saved           = yes (where: git commit hash | folder | ...)
> push_confirmed_by_user = yes | no
> push_exit_code         = 0
> visibility            = public | private (action needed)
> ```

---

## Phase 4: Register, then offer a test run

Register the image. Then ask the user whether to submit a scored test run.
Do not submit one on your own.

### Register

**Ask the user to confirm the slug and version before running the CLI.**
Registration creates a catalog entry for their organization, and the tag
becomes an immutable version string.

```sh
manifold policy init <slug> \
  --image <registry>/<namespace>/policy-<slug>:<tag> \
  --minimum-gpu-memory-gb <N>
```

The image tag becomes the version. So
`--image ghcr.io/<your-org>/policy-mypolicy-mybench:0.1.0` registers version
`0.1.0`.

**`--minimum-gpu-memory-gb` does two things.** It filters which runners
can accept this image (the scheduler compares against reported GPU
memory), and it decides whether the container gets GPU access (`--gpus
all` is only added to `docker run` when `minimum_gpu_memory_gb > 0`). A
GPU model registered with 0 starts without GPU access — it will run very
slowly on CPU or crash at model load. Set `<N>` to the model's actual GPU
memory footprint, rounded up.

**Visibility.** By default a new policy is visible only to its own
organization. Add `--visibility public` only if the user asks for it.

### Offer a scored test run

Registration is done. The image is live on the platform, but you have
not yet seen the platform pull it, schedule it, drive it, and score it.
Only a scored run does that.

**Ask the user whether to submit one.** Something like: "The image is
registered as version `X`. Do you want to submit a scored test run? If
so, which registered benchmark should I pair it against? A run costs
cloud time."

Do not pick a benchmark. Do not submit on your own. If the user says no,
stop here — the skill is done.

If the user says yes and names a benchmark, run:

```sh
manifold run submit <policy-slug> <benchmark-slug>
manifold run watch <run-id>
```

Before submitting:

- The named benchmark must be registered and must have a working image.
  If the run fails immediately with an error naming the benchmark image
  (missing image, benchmark container crash on start), that is a
  benchmark-side problem, not a wrap bug — flag it to the Bifrost team.
- Runs are visible to everyone in the organization — use a clear
  `--name` if the user wants the run labeled.
- There is no hardware check before scheduling. A benchmark that needs
  a specific GPU will be scheduled onto a box without one and fail at
  runtime.

### Validate the results

A completed run does not mean the wrap is correct. Check the actual
output.

**Episode completion.** All episodes should reach `completed`:

```sh
manifold run get <run-id> --episodes
```

**First frames.** Dump the first observation frame from each episode. A
run once scored 0.4 in a scene with no background. A mostly black first
frame means the scene did not load.

**Action magnitudes.** Actions should be in the physical range for the
embodiment (millimeters, radians). Actions stuck at the edges (all 1.0 or
all -1.0) suggest missing denormalization.

**Score vs reference.** Compare `mean_success` against the checkpoint's
published or previously measured score on this suite.

**This is the only point in the whole flow where convention bugs become
visible.** A wrong gripper sign, a wrong component order, a wrong rotation
encoding, or a wrong proprioception mapping all pass `check_compatibility`
and `verify`. They only show up here as a score near zero.

A near-zero score on a suite the checkpoint is known to handle means a
wrap bug until proven otherwise. Go back to `wrap-policy` Phase 3, fix
the pipeline or session, bump the tag, and re-enter this skill at
Phase 3.

## Final checklist

Inputs

- [ ] Wrap passes `check_compatibility` and `verify` under `wrap-policy`
- [ ] Policy slug received from the setup skill (not invented); image
      name constructed from it
- [ ] manifold-sdk version in the image matches the version the wrap
      was written against

Image contents

- [ ] Base image pinned by digest, not by a floating tag like `latest`
- [ ] Project source pinned (git commit `ARG` or snapshot tarball) so
      rebuilds match
- [ ] Only the folders `driver.py` imports from are `COPY`ed;
      `PYTHONPATH` set so those imports resolve
- [ ] Model's Python dependencies pinned (`numpy`, `scipy`, etc.) so
      a rebuild can't silently upgrade them
- [ ] Weights approach decided: fetched at first load *or* baked in
- [ ] No credentials baked into the image (no `ENV HF_TOKEN=...`, no
      copied `~/.aws/credentials`, no copied `~/.huggingface/token`)

Dockerfile rules

- [ ] Dockerfile builds without errors
- [ ] On a GPU box, container starts and prints its listening line;
      on a CPU-only box, skipped (rely on Phase 4)
- [ ] Port 8000, bound on `0.0.0.0`
- [ ] `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` set
- [ ] Bash present in the image
- [ ] No network fetch at model construction (weights are already local
      by the time the model loads)
- [ ] GPU pre-allocation disabled where the framework does it by
      default (e.g. JAX)

Push and register

- [ ] Tag never reused; Dockerfile and launcher saved before push
- [ ] Push confirmed by the user
- [ ] Registry package visible so the platform can pull the image
- [ ] Registration confirmed by the user; correct
      `--minimum-gpu-memory-gb` (never 0 for GPU models)
- [ ] User was offered a scored test run and given the choice

If the user asked for a test run:

- [ ] Benchmark chosen by the user; submit confirmed before running
- [ ] Test run completed; score compared to reference
- [ ] First frames and action ranges inspected
